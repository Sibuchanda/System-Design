## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is an Abstract Class in C++?
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It is designed to be a base class and usually contains at least one pure virtual function.

A pure virtual function is declared like this:

`virtual void display() = 0;`

The = 0 tells the compiler: ‚ÄúThis function has no implementation here, it must be overridden by derived classes.‚Äù

## 2Ô∏è‚É£Why we need Abstract class? Whithout Abstract class what will be the problem?

I am running a delivery company. There are different types of delivery drivers:
- Bike Driver
- Truck Driver
- Drone Delivery

They all do the same job deliver packages but in their own way.

So what do I do?

I tell every driver:

"You MUST have a way to deliver a package. I don‚Äôt care how you do it ‚Äî bike, truck, drone ‚Äî but you MUST have that method."

This is what an abstract class does.
It says:

"Every child class MUST follow this rule, but can have their own style of doing it."

### üö´ What if we don‚Äôt use an abstract class?

Then:
- Some drivers might forget to add the deliverPackage() method.
- Our system would crash when you try to call deliverPackage() on a driver that doesn‚Äôt have it.
- We will have a messy system where some drivers deliver, and others don‚Äôt ‚Äî no rules! Like if there is 10 to 20 types of delivery methods and if some delivery classes are not have any delivary methods then, they are just polluting the code.


## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Why NO implementation of functions in base class?

Because sometimes, the base class doesn‚Äôt know the details.

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre making a program for animals.

` class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() = 0;  // I don't know what sound, just know every animal makes one
};`

We can‚Äôt write a sound here, because:
- A dog barks
- A cat meows
- A cow moos

So the abstract class (Animal) says: "I know every animal makes a sound, but I don‚Äôt know which one, so I won‚Äôt implement it."

That‚Äôs the advantage: it forces every child to define its own behavior, and avoids wrong or default behavior.


## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Why do we use A* obj = new B(); instead of B* obj = new B(); in C++?

We use A* obj = new B(); because it enables runtime polymorphism.
- This means we can write code that works with any class derived from A, not just B.
- The actual method (show()) that gets called is decided at runtime, based on the object type (B in this case).

#### Real-Life Analogy:
Think of A as a Remote Control interface, and B, C, D as different TV brands. With A* obj = new B();, you're saying:

"I can control any brand, as long as it follows the remote interface." This makes our code flexible and scalable.

#### What if we use B* obj = new B();?
- It works, but the code becomes tightly coupled to class B.
- If we later switch to class C, we‚Äôll have to change the type everywhere in the code.
- This reduces reusability and maintainability.

#### Conclusion
- Use **B\* obj = new B();** if you are only working with class B.
- Use **A\* obj = new B();** if you want flexibility to work with any class that inherits A  great for big applications, frameworks, or when writing reusable code.


## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Difference beween `B* obj = new B();` and `B* obj;` ?

`B* obj = new B();` -->  This line creates an object and gives you a pointer to it. Means it will create a new B object in heap memory and give me its address.
- A new object is created in heap (dynamic memory).
- obj now points to that object.
- You can use obj-> to call methods on it.
- You are responsible for deleting it later using delete obj;

#### When to use:
- When you want dynamic memory allocation.
- When you want to pass it around using base class pointers (A* obj = new B();)


B* obj; --> This line just declares a pointer, but does not point to anything yet. Means We are creating a pointer to a B object, but we are not assigning any object to it right now.

#### What happens:
- The pointer exists but contains garbage or NULL until you assign something.
- If you try to use it without assigning, it will crash (undefined behavior).

#### Conclusion 
- B* obj = new B(); is like:
  - "Booking a hotel room and getting the key right away."

- B* obj; is like:
  - "Saying you‚Äôll stay in a hotel, but you haven‚Äôt booked or got any room yet."


  ## 6Ô∏è‚É£ What is Abstract class and Interface in C++?

  #### What is an Abstract Class?
  An abstract class is a class that cannot be directly used to create objects, but it can provide:
- Some methods with code (implementation) 
- Some methods without code (pure virtual functions) 

``` 
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() = 0;  // pure virtual function
    void breathe() {
        cout << "Animal breathes oxygen" << endl;  // with implementation
    }
};
```
#### What is an Interface (in C++ style)?
C++ doesn't have a built-in interface keyword like Java or C#.
But we simulate an interface by using an abstract class where all methods are pure virtual and there are no data members or implemented methods.

```
class IPrintable {
public:
    virtual void print() = 0;  // only pure virtual methods
    virtual void print2() = 0;  // Two pure virtual methods
};
```

### Difference Between Abstract Class and Interface in C++

| Feature                   | Abstract Class                                 | Interface (in C++)                         |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Can have method bodies?   | ‚úÖ Yes (some methods can be implemented)        | ‚ùå No (all must be pure virtual)           |
| Can have data members?    | ‚úÖ Yes                                           | ‚ùå No                                       |
| Multiple inheritance?     | üö´ Risky (C++ allows but tricky)                 | ‚úÖ Easy, multiple interfaces possible       |
| Use case                  | Base class with common code                     | Rule book for unrelated classes            |
| Object creation           | ‚ùå No (can't make object directly)              | ‚ùå No                                       |
